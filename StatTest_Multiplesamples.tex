The most common two in biological studies are the Tukey test and the
Student-Newman-Keuls test. The Tukey test is reputed to be the most powerful of
the two. REQUIREMENTS for ANOVA: read Sect.\ref{sec:F-test_variance}.
When the requirements for ANOVA are not met, Tukey test with ranked sums can be
used. This test is not available through all statistical programs and may need
to be calculated by hand.

\section{Variance comparison}

To test if $k$ samples from population with equal variances, we can use
Bartlett's test (Sect.\ref{sec:Bartlett-Box_test}). If the data violate the
normality, we can use other tests: Levene's test or Brown-Forsythe test.
