\section{Dealing with a package}
\label{sec:dealing-with-package}

\subsection{Install a package}
\label{sec:install-package-1}


To install a package\footnote{\url{http://support.stat.ucla.edu/view.php?supportid=30 
}}.

\begin{lstlisting}
> install.packages("package_name")
\end{lstlisting}

Example: the {\it aplpack} package 
\begin{lstlisting}
> install.packages("aplpack")
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Load/Unload an installed package}
\label{sec:load-an-inst}

In R, there are many user defined packages. The system has some
automatically loadded/attached packages: base, stats, datasets...
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cl}
    graphics & all functions to produce graphics \\
    grDevices & all functions to handle different devices for graphics
    \\
    datasets & objects from different sample data sets \\
    utils  & all standard R utility functions \\
    stats & all standard R functions for statistical data analysis \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Standard packages}
\end{table}


\textbullet List all loaded packages with {\bf search()}
\begin{lstlisting}
>> search() 
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics" 
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets" 
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base" 
\end{lstlisting}
The first location, the package with index = 1, is always.GlobalEnv.

\textbullet List all loaded packages with {\bf sessionInfo()}
\begin{lstlisting}
>> sessionInfo()
R version 2.7.1 (2008-06-23) 
i486-pc-linux-gnu 

locale:
LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8;
LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8;LC_MONETARY=C;LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8;
LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8;LC_NAME=C;LC_ADDRESS=C;LC_TELEPHONE=C;
LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8;LC_IDENTIFICATION=C 

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base 
\end{lstlisting}

\textbullet List all installed package, use {\bf library()} function
\begin{lstlisting}
>> library()
Packages in library '/usr/lib/R/library':

base                    The R Base Package
boot                    Bootstrap R (S-Plus) Functions (Canty)
class                   Functions for Classification
cluster                 Cluster Analysis Extended Rousseeuw et al.
codetools               Code Analysis Tools for R
datasets                The R Datasets Package
......
\end{lstlisting}

A function in a package should be used explicitly with its package
name in front. This is similar to using the variable within an object
(e.g. the column names within a data.frame object).  However, you can
load the package so that calling to the function can be used without
the package name.


\textbullet To load a package, use {\bf attach(obj), attach(lib.name)}
or {\bf library(lib.name)} function.
\begin{lstlisting}
>> library(cluster)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbullet Each loaded package is associated with an index value
(found in the {\it search()} function), user can use this value to
list all functions in that package using {\bf ls(pos=index)} function.
\begin{lstlisting}
> ls(2) # 2 is stats
 [1] "agnes"                   "agriculture"            
 [3] "animals"                 "bannerplot"             
 [5] "chorSub"                 "clara"                  
 [7] "clusplot"                "coef.hclust"            
 [9] "daisy"                   "diana"                  
[11] "ellipsoidhull"           "ellipsoidPoints"        
[13] "fanny"                   "flower"                 
[15] "lower.to.upper.tri.inds" "meanabsdev"             
[17] "mona"                    "pam"                    
[19] "plantTraits"             "pltree"                 
[21] "pluton"                  "predict.ellipsoid"      
[23] "ruspini"                 "silhouette"             
[25] "sizeDiss"                "sortSilhouette"         
[27] "upper.to.lower.tri.inds" "volume"                 
[29] "votes.repub"             "xclara"    
\end{lstlisting}

  \textbullet If you want the packages to be automatically loaded
  every time, there are 2 ways 

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Click Packages\textbackslash Load and choose the
  package to load 
  \item Put it in the .First() function. This requires you
  to know the package name, use this below function to list the names
  of packages.  
\begin{lstlisting}
>> select.list(sort(.packages(all.available=TRUE)))
\end{lstlisting}
  Then, in the .First() function, add this line: \lstinline!library(lib_name)!
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{MASS}
\label{sec:mass}

Authors: Venables and Ripley, 2002

The contour() and the persp() functions create contour plots, and three dimensional sur-
faces. Here, these functions are used to plot contours and 3-D graph of a surface fitted to a
set of topological measurements in topo (from the MASS package). First, a surface is fitted
to the data using the loess() function in R. The fitted surface is used to obtain predicted
values z over a 2-dimensional grid (named as topo.grid below). The R generic function
predict() is useful for this purpose. The function expand.grid() used below, creates a
data frame from all combinations of the two vectors x and y.
\begin{lstlisting}
> data(topo)
> topo
> topo.surf=loess(zx*y,topo,span=0.25)
> topo.surf
> topo.grid=list(x=seq(0,6.5,0.2),y=seq(0,6.5,0.2))
> topo.z=predict(topo.surf, expand.grid(topo.grid))
> contour(topo.grid$x,topo.grid$y,topo.z)
> points(topo)
> persp(topo.grid$x,topo.grid$y,topo.z)
> persp(topo.grid$x,topo.grid$y,topo.z,theta=40,phi=40)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{ROCR}
\label{sec:rocr}


28 performance measures are implemented, which can be freely combined
to form parametric curves such as {\it ROC curves},
{\it precision/recall curves}, or {\it lift curves}. Many options such
as curve averaging (for cross-validation or bootstrap), augmenting the
averaged curves by standard error bar or boxplots, labeling cutoffs to
the curve, or coloring curves according to cutoff \footnote{\url{http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de/}}.

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{sciplot}
\label{sec:sciplot}

The package "sciplot" is now available for download from CRAN. This
package includes a collection of functions that create graphs with
error bars for data collected from one-way or higher factorial
designs, as well as a function to plot bifurcation diagrams resulting
from analysis with XPPAUTO. The functions in this package replicate
some of the functionality of {\bf plotmeans()} from the package {\it gplots}, with
differences in the treatment of two-way and higher designs. Example
graphs can be seen at: \url{http://mutualism.williams.edu/sciplot}

\section{Packages with problem solving}
\label{sec:pack-with-probl}

\subsection{plyr}
\label{sec:plyr}

{\bf plyr} is a set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you
need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on
each pieces and then put all the pieces back together.  It's already
possible to do this with {\bf split()} and the {\bf apply()}
functions, but plyr just makes it all a bit easier with:

\begin{itemize}
\item consistent names, arguments and outputs

\item input from and output to data.frames, matrices and lists

\item progress bars to keep track of long running operations

\item built-in error recovery

\item the choice of passing chunks as rows or as variables
\end{itemize}

plyr functions are named according to the type of object they input
(first letter) and output (second letter):

\begin{itemize}
\item   llply = from a list to a list
\item  alply = from an array (or vector, or matrix) to a list
\item  ldply = from a list to a data.frame
\item   \verb!d_ply! = from a data.frame, ignore output
\item and so on for llply, laply, ldply, \verb!l_ply!, alply, aaply,
  adply, \verb!a_ply!, dlply, daply, dply, \verb!d_ply!
\end{itemize}

plyr also provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item    m*ply which works in a similar way to mapply
\item   r*ply which works in a similar way to replicate
\end{itemize}

You can find out more at \url{http://had.co.nz/plyr/}, including a 20
page introductory guide\footnote{\url{http://had.co.nz/plyr/plyr-intro.pdf}}.


\section{Packages for model analysis}
\label{sec:pack-model-analys}

\subsection{Caret}
\label{sec:caret}

caret is a package for {\it building} and {\it evaluating} a wide
variety of predictive models. There are functions for pre-processing,
tuning models using resampling, visualizing the results, calculating
performance and estimating variable importance. 

{\bf caretNWS} and {\bf caretLSF} are two parallel processing versions
that can reduce the training time when multiple compute nodes are
available.

The project is now hosted on
\href{http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/}{R-Forge}.  The package
currently includes {\bf model tuning/resampling} for the following
models: lm, single trees (C4.5, rpart, ctree, logistic model trees),
mars (via earth), boosted models (ada, gbm, blackboost, glmboost,
gamboost, logitboost), bagged models (trees, earth, fda),
randomforests (randomforest and cforest), rule-based models (Ripper
and M5 prime), discriminant models (lda, fda, rda, ssda, slda), kernel
methods (lssvm, ksvm, rvm, gausspr), nnet, nnet with initial pca step,
multinom, pls, plsda, gpls, nearest shrunken centroids, the lasso, the
elastic net, supervised pca, knn, lvq and NaiveBayes.

Recent changes include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimation of class probabilities from PLS discriminant analysis
  using Bayes rule (in addition to softmax)
\item Added predict.train and predit.list

\item More lattice plots to visualize resampling results (xyplot,
  stripplot, densitplot, histogram) 

\item User-specified performance metrics for resampling

\item User-specified algorithms for determining the optimal tuning
  parameters (instead of highest/lowest)

\item A CHANGES files now exists to track the specifics of the version
  changes
