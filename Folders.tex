\chapter{Folders}
\label{chap:folders}


Wherever you run the R interpreter, it is the working directory of the
current workspace. Any access to any folder without the absolute path
is relatively to this folder. However, we can change it.

\textbullet Set the new working directory
\begin{lstlisting}
>> setwd(new_dir)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbullet To retrieve the full path of the working directory
\begin{lstlisting}
>> getwd()
\end{lstlisting}

{\bf Example}:
\begin{lstlisting}
setwd(paste(getwd(), "/BINF 702/Assign.02", 
           sep = ""))  # at Lab
setwd("F:/Textbooks/BINF 702/Data for BINF702")
setwd("F:\\Textbooks\\BINF 702\\Data for BINF702\\")
\end{lstlisting}

Supporting function: we need some string manipulation functions,
e.g. paste().
